In addition to their core project, participants in this course will engage with a series of texts, discuss them together, and share reflections on the course blog about the progress of their projects in the context of the history and theory of co-design.

### Projects & Partners

Projects must have a clearly defined community partner that is a worker-owned co-op and must be approved by Professor Costanza-Chock. Early in the semester, several potential project partners will pitch their work to students. Students will rank order their preference and the teaching team will make every effort to assemble teams that balance interest with diverse skills.
